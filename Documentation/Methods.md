**Telefang Transcription methods**
* Open the .gbs file with foobar2000 (v2.1.5)
* I used the x86 (32bit) foobar version, with Game Emu Player extension added. * The 64bit foobar version did not work with that Game Emu Player extension, for me.
* Using the Game Emu Player extension, you can check the boxes for each of the 4 gameboy channels individually, and export the four channels for each track (one by one).
* Drag the 4 channel files into Audacity. Solo the channels individually and play them as needed, to create the transcription. Slow down if needed. Examine the waveforms to note:
-Duty cycles for the pulse channels
-Waveform shape for the wave channel
-Noise channel instruments (see noise analysis)
* Transcribe into Musescore, following the Template I set up (based on Mark Benis' Pkmn Red/Blue score)
* Export from Musescore:
-PDF score
-MIDI
-MusicXML
-Musescore file itself
* Track progress of which tracks have been completed on the table
* Make corrections and release updates as needed.
