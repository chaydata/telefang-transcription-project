**Telefang Transcription methods**
* Open the .gbs file with foobar2000 (v2.1.5)
* I used the x86 (32bit) foobar version, with Game Emu Player extension added. The *64bit* foobar version did not work with that Game Emu Player extension, for me, hence choosing the *32bit* version instead.
* Using the Game Emu Player extension, you can check the boxes for each of the 4 gameboy channels individually, and export the four channels for each track (one by one). To do this, the specific steps are:
  * Select a track from the Playlist window, hit the play button (near the top), then from the top left menus, choose View > GEP control. The GEP control window should open.
  * You will see checkboxes for each of the four channels (apparently these do not appear if you are not playing the track). Un/check to isolate one channel. Close the GEP window and you can stop the music now.
  * In the playlist window, right click the track > Convert > Quick convert. Choose WAV (or whatever works for you, really). Click "Convert". Choose a location to put the file and click OK.
  * Repeat for each of the four channels for the track. When you are done that, you won't need foodbar (until the next track you're working on), so close.
* Drag the 4 channel files into Audacity. Solo the channels individually and play them as needed, to create the transcription. Slow down if needed. Examine the waveforms to note:
  * Duty cycles for the pulse channels
  * Waveform shape for the wave channel
  * Noise channel instruments (see noise analysis)
* Transcribe into Musescore, following the Template I set up (roughly based on Mark Benis' Pkmn Red/Blue score)
* Export from Musescore:
  * PDF score
  * MIDI
  * MusicXML
  * Musescore file itself
* Track progress of which tracks have been completed on the table
* Make corrections and release updates as needed.
