**Rationale**
* Appreciate the great music by Kinuyo Yamashita
* Useful to help create your own covers and arrangements
* Analyze the musical harmony and melody, or game boy / chiptune channel methods
* Play the music on piano or whatever, for fun

## Downloads  

You can download by navigating to individual GitHub files in this repository, opening the file page, and then clicking the top right download icon (or the three dots > Download; or Ctrl + Shift + S).
In future (when there's more transcriptions done) I may make zip folders (e.g. all the PDFs) and put things up on the Releases page of this repo.

## Features  
* Documentation
  * The **TelefangTranscriptionsTable.csv**, which is useful to see which tracks are done or in progress
  * Noise Analysis: my notes on the distinct noise channel "percussion instruments"
  * Other notes: methods (how this was done) and references (related links)
* MIDI
  * Midi files exported directly from the Musescore file for each transcription
  * These can be used in DAWs, music notation software, or elsewhere
* Musescore
  * Musescore files (music notation software, where the transcriptions are made)
  * If you want to use these files, you can [download musescore for free](https://musescore.org/)
* MusicXML
  * MusicXML files exported directly from the Musescore file for each transcription
  * Basically this is a kind of open file format for music notation files (like an alternative to Musescore - should be able to open with other music notation software!)
* PDFs
  *  PDF files exported directly from the Musescore file for each transcription
  *  Suitable for printing to play along or analysis

## Frequently Asked Questions

> Do you have music for ____ track?

Check the "TelefangTranscriptionsTable.csv" (under the Documentation folder)  

> Can you transcribe ____ track next?  

Please go ahead and [contact me](#contributors) to ask! I may already have some others planned first, and it may depend how complex the track is, and how busy I am with life. But knowing someone actually *wants* a certain track can be very helpful motivation.

> How do I download anything?

See the [Downloads section](#Downloads)  

> Can I contribute?

Maybe! I'm still thinking about how that could work. In terms of creating the transcriptions, I want to have consistent quality and ideally have things done with my standard methods (see Documentation). If you have any other input (e.g. track name input? other?), I'm open to receiving ideas, but no guarantee I'll go with them.

## License

I haven't chosen a formal license (yet), but my intentions are:
* Free: You are free to use whatever you want from here, for whatever you want (no cost or limitations)
* Caveat: I'm not liable for any accuracy or other issues - this is all distributed without any warranty!
* Credit: If you use material from here (e.g. to make covers, sheet music arrangements for other instruments, etc.), you should of course credit the original game music composer **Kinuyo Yamashita**, and optionally if you *want* or *can*, also credit this project and/or the transcriber, since that's always nice (but not strictly necessary)!
